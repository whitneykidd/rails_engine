### Rails Engine

Rails Engine is the first solo project for Mod 3.

Premise:

- You are working for a company developing an E-Commerce Application. 

- Your team is working in a service-oriented architecture, meaning the front and back ends of this application are separate and communicate via APIs.

- Your job is to expose the data that powers the site through an API that the front end will consume.

### Learning Goals
Expose an API.
Use serializers to format json responses
Test API exposure
Compose advanced ActiveRecord queries to analyze information stored in SQL databases.
Write basic SQL statements without the assistance of an ORM.
